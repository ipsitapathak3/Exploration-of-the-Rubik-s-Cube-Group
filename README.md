# Exploration of the Rubik's Cube Group
In this project, we will explore the Rubik's Cube puzzle with the help of SageMath. We
will be discussing the Rubik's Cube Group and some of its interesting properties, various
algorithms that can be used to solve a Rubik's cube, some of which utilize group theory,
Sage's Rubik's cube group functions and nally talk about how SAT solvers could be used
to solve Rubik's Cubes.
